# Creating a request
In order to create a new request, you can use our cli generators. You can use on the terminal: `yarn generate`.
Then you should select the `service API` option and give it a name, such as `users`.
It will create a new folder in the `src/services/api` folder with the request and its tests.

You should normally use the request helpers to create the request. They are:
- apiGet - used to make a GET request
- apiPost - used to make a POST request
- apiPut - used to make a PUT request
- apiDelete - used to make a DELETE request

They can be imported from the index file of `src/services/api`

You normally will want to test if the request calls axios api with correct params (such as url, headers and params).
A good file to look for an example is the following: `src/services/api/nonProfitsApi/index.test.ts`
