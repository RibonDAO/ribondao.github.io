# Api hooks
In order to organize better our requests and reuse them in multiple pages, it is a good practice to create
api hooks that encapsulate those requests (see how to create them on the previous section).

These hooks are located at `src/hooks/apiHooks`

## The useApi hook
We created an useApi hook that uses `react-query` and has some pre-definitions that makes easier to cache and make requests inside hooks.
Normally you will encapsulate your request inside the useApi hook, and return the data among other functions
that a component/page would need to consume this api.

You can use it as following:
```
const { data: someNameToYourData, isLoading, refetch } = useApi<TypeReturnedFromTheRequest>({
    key: "keyToCacheTheRequest",
    fetchMethod: () => {
      return someMethodThatCallsTheApi # created on previous section
    }
});
```

This hook exposes as well the `isLoading` boolean, which tells if the request is still loading (useful to show loading states in the page) and `refecth` method, that can be called again
in the page to force the request to be made again.

A good example of this kind of hook is the `src/hooks/apiHooks/useNonProfits/index.ts` hook. It gets information about the
non-profits of the app and returns it to the pages.
