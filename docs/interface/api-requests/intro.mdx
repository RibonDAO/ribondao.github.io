# Introduction
Our api requests are located inside `src/services/api` directory. There we have an index file that makes the initial configuration of our API requests.
We are currently using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) library to make the requests.

We use some interceptors in the requests. All of our requests are snake cased before sending them to the server, and they are camel cased when receiving information from the server.
This is done in order to follow each language's conventions (camel case for typescript and snake case for Ruby).

The following sections will have further explanation about how to make requests and things to make them more reusable
in the whole app.
