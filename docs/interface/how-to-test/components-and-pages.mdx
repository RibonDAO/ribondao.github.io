# Components and Pages
Now that you already know about the main helpers in our app, we can start to think about some ways to test our components and pages.
Remember to use the helpers when testing those components and pages.

## How to test components

We have a component directory in `src/components`. There you should create only components that receive props and have a state.
They are not coupled to any hooks, contexts or application related code.

You can think of this `components` directory as a library that could be copied to any other project and still work.There you normally test the behavior of your component. For example, for a `<Button />` component we could test if the props passed to it are showed in the screen
and if it calls the right function when it is pressed.

You can check the test for the `<Button />` component in the `src/components/atomics/Button/index.test.tsx` file in the project.
It is a good reference of what to test on components.

## How to test pages

Normally the pages will have a group of components and an expected behavior. We tend to test the whole behavior of the page, like an integration test.
Usually, those behaviors are:
- The page logs an event when it is loaded or something is clicked.
- The page makes a request to the API to get some data.
- The page navigates to another page when something is clicked.
- The page shows the right content (texts, titles, etc.).

There is a good example using the test helpers in the `src/pages/promoters/FundPage/index.test.tsx` file. This is the test for the Treasure page of the app.

## Generators
We have some generators that helps us to create boilerplate code for components and pages. If you run `yarn generate` on the terminal you'll be prompted to choose one of those generators.
The `Component` and `Page` generators already create a test file with the main helpers imported already for you to start.

Everytime that is possible you should use the generators to create new components, pages and other things that have generators.
