# CI/CD and Clean Code

## Prettier

We have a .prettierrc file that contains all the default pdajsdajksd

## Husky

We use husky as an improvement to our commits. Every commit must pass all the tests and fulfill the requirements of prettier.

## CI

Today we have a CI on Github actions. In every pull request (PR), you must request a review and it's necessary that someone approves your commit, after the review process.
After you PR is approved, a Deploy PR will automatically be created.
