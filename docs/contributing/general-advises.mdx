## Engineering standards

Code merged into the `main` branch should adhere to high standards of correctness and maintainability. 
Use your best judgment when applying these standards.

- Have at least one engineer approve
- Write unit tests
- Thoroughly unit test when code is not obviously correct
- If something breaks, add automated tests so it doesn't break again
- Verify that all CI checks pass before merging
- Have at least one product manager or designer approve of any significant UX changes

## Guidelines

The following points should help guide your development:

- Security: the interface is safe to use
  - Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies due to [supply chain risk](https://github.com/LavaMoat/lavamoat#further-reading-on-software-supplychain-security)
- Reproducibility: anyone can build the interface
  - Avoid adding steps to the development/build processes
  - The build must be deterministic, i.e. a particular commit hash always produces the same build
- Decentralization: anyone can run the interface
  - An Ethereum node should be the only critical dependency 
  - All other external dependencies should only enhance the UX ([graceful degradation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Graceful_degradation))
- Accessibility: anyone can use the interface
  - The interface should be responsive, small and also run well on low performance devices
