# Welcome to Ribon Docs!

Ribon is a decentralized donation platform that allows donors to become promoters and, by doing so, encourages others to join them in a global culture of giving. This way itâ€™s possible to increase donations to charities, promote a culture of giving in the world and make people happier. The decentralized platform is governed by the community, and this whitepaper is a reader-friendly description of the Ribon protocol, which is built on Matic/Polygon, a layer 2 in Ethereum.

In the next sections you'll be able to find most of the information about and how to contribute to Ribon's projects.
